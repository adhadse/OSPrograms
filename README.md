# OS_programs
This repo holds my OS Lab programs for the Fourth Semester. 
## Feel free to use and learn from them.

### CPUScheduler.cpp 
This file holds class `Scheduler` for most commonly used functions and well as `Process` class for holding attributes of Process (Sort of Process Control Block). 

The `Scheduler` Class and Classes which inherits this class uses Process objects to manipulate and simulate a certain type of sceduling. Examples of using these specialized class can be seen from the function writtenn below, then you can run them one by one and see how the process get exxecuted one by one.

### CPUScheduler.kt 
This file was originally written but later on I wrote most programs in C++. If you love â™¥ to see the code in KOTLIN, which is much more easier to read; you can get a hang of the code before switching to C++ program.
